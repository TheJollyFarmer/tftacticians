    <p>With the Skyglass assembled, Pengu has accessed an all new arsenal.</p>
    <p>
      <span> Radiant Items </span> are the new set mechanic for Dawn of Heroes.
      Like Shadow Items, each Vanilla completed Item will have a Radiant
      version, but this time, they’ll simply be a more OP version of the
      original Item with no drawbacks. In fact, they’re so OP that we can only
      give you one per game. But don’t worry, you’ll get to choose your Radiant
      Item from a selection of five in the Radiant Armory that appears for all
      players at stage 3-6.
