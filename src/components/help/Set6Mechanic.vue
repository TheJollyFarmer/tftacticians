      <span>Hextech Augments</span> are a new mechanic thatâ€™ll tap into your
      inner mad scientist. Some Augments break rules while others create new
      ones, allowing you to reinvent your game time and time again! Be on the
      lookout for all the unique Hextech Augments and insane combinations,
      because right now there are over 140 Hextech Augments that you could end
      up with! There are three tiers of Augments, ranging from least powerful
      to most powerful. Some Augments are unique to one tier, while others have
      multiple versions across different power tiers. All players get access to
      Augments of equal power at the same time, although the specific Augments
      offered may vary.
